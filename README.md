# Speech-in-noise comprehension: SINON
Speech-in-noise comprehension (SPINCO) subproject: **online** study presenting words in noise and vocoded. Neurolinguistics group (University of Zurich). Internet study presented with Gorilla. 

There were three tasks: lexical decision (LD), picture matching (PM), 2 alternative forced choice (2FC). 


# Issues

- First preprocessing scripts need refinment (e.g., relativ paths) 
- *Gen_stimuli/Gen_sequences* requires revision and explicit documentation on order in which scripts were run. Make clear which ones are drafts
