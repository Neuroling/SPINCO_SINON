# Scripts for generating spreadsheets

These spreadsheets were used in Gorilla , a web app for running experiments online. The app needs a list with file names, block index, etc. 
There were three tasks: LD,PM and 2FC, each needed slightly different fields in the spreadsheets

Scripts run order is indicated in filenames. Non-numbered files were not involved in final experiment
